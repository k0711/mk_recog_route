Assessment methods as tools for learning and progression</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>During my career I have been involved in all forms of assessment, including setting and marking credit-bearing university essays and exams. Here I shall comment principally on my use of assessment as a tool for learning and progression -- that is, formative assessment. I think of this as a GPS system on the learning journey, allowing student and teacher to see where they are and what course corrections they need to make in order to progress. I use a range of methods, formal and informal, depending on the nature and level of the course I am teaching. In FE settings I use essays (both short and long), group discussion, class debates, presentations, and mock exams (for samples, see this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8g3pmsM7GtmGxGZ.htm" target="_blank"><span>scheme of work</span></a><span>, this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts884RpsHxHj9d57w.htm" target="_blank"><span>mid-term essay assignment</span></a><span>, and this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gwMsqynjbRqr8W.htm" target="_blank"><span>end-of-term assessment</span></a><span>. In primary school contexts, I use less formal methods, including short essays, quizzes and tests. I also find student presentations useful for assessment, especially as students particularly enjoy them. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>E2. Fair and equitable assessment</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Inequitable assessment is not only unethical but also counterproductive, since it gives inaccurate guidance to student, teacher, and others, and I am scrupulous in striving to minimise even unconscious bias in my assessment. For formal evaluations I practice blind marking where possible, and I welcome second-marking and monitoring. I also make sure to give assessment feedback in a standard format, so that no one feels differently treated, while at the same leaving space for individual comments. I always give students explanations of their marks, either formally or informally (see this sample of </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gGmW7HxRgppnnw.htm" target="_blank"><span>exam feedback</span></a><span>). With regard to informal assessment (e.g., on presentations, group discussion etc.), I make the process as open as possible and where feasible employ self- and peer assessment as well (see below). </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>E3 Involving learners in the assessment process </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>I always aim to make assessment a rewarding experience for students. I stress that its purpose is constructive and always highlight the positive aspects of students’ work as well indicating areas for improvement. I offer feedback on marks (see E2 and E4) and am always ready to discuss marks with students. I also seek to involve learners in assessment itself. The ability to assess one’s own work and correct it is a key learning skill, which I seek to inculcate in my students. I encourage students to reflect on their answers and assess their confidence in them, to use ‘think aloud’ protocols in problem solving, and to anticipate feedback and redraft their work accordingly. I also make heavy use of peer marking and (constructive) class assessment of individual and group work.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>E4 Feedback as a tool for learning and progression </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>I always offer students extensive notes on their work (see this sample of </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88RdrG65y6Gt75w.htm" target="_blank"><span>tutorial feedback</span></a><span> and this sample of </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88Z8spc4ngkm43h.htm" target="_blank"><span>essay feedback</span></a><span>). I find it particularly useful to have students review, redraft, and hone their work in response to my feedback, so that assessment feeds directly into skill development. (This also gives students the satisfaction of having produced a polished piece of work, of which they can be proud.) I also use feedback from students as the basis for future planning, drawing up individual progress plans with students and making adjustments to my micro-planning. (For more on my use of student feedback in my planning, see D2.)</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>E5 Working within institutional procedures for assessment and monitoring of learner progress </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Having held senior administrative roles in education, I am keenly aware of the importance of adhering scrupulously to institutional procedures for assessment and student monitoring. As a Course Manager at the Open University I was responsible for supervising these procedures, often on courses with huge populations (see this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts88hWh8nqt8HRsrM.htm" target="_blank"><span>job description</span></a><span>). As Acting Head of Philosophy at Newcastle-under-Lyme College I attended Exam Board briefings and was responsible for implementing the prescribed assessment procedures in my department. And wherever I have taught I have taken part in institutional audit procedures and prepared full reports on the courses I teach (see this </span><a href="jbkbsgZd9ts8gGqRbxdGwG4sny.htm" target="_blank"><span>sample report</span></a><span>).</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span></span></p></div><div class="clear"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="padfooter"><div class="themegradient"></div></div></div></div><div class="slide-out-handles" style="left: 50%; margin-left: 460px;"><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Info/jbkbsgZd9ts8gzyyp9ckcyrgfZInfo.htm"><img src="Icons/infoTab.png" alt="Asset Info"/></a><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Feedback/jbkbsgZd9ts8gzyyp9ckcyrgfZFeedback.htm"><img src="Icons/feedbackTab.png" alt="Asset Feedback"/></a><a class="handle comments-tab" style="position: relative" id="comment_tab" target="_blank" href="Links/jbkbsgZd9ts8gzyyp9ckcyrgfZLinks.htm"><img src="Icons/linkTab.png" alt="Asset Links"/></a></div></div></body></html>
